# OpenGL Dynamic Shader

## Overview

This project demonstrates a dynamic particle effect shader built with OpenGL. The application features interactive controls that allow users to modify the visual appearance of the shader in real-time. The shader showcases continuous color transitions and particle effects, creating a dynamic and engaging visualization.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Shader:**
   - Particle effects with continuously varying colors.
   - Parameters like zoom, intensity, and duration dynamically adjust based on user input.

2. **Interactivity:**
   - **Keyboard Controls:**
     - Arrow keys to adjust zoom and intensity.
     - `W`/`S` to change animation duration.
   - **Mouse Controls:**
     - Move the mouse to control zoom and duration.

3. **Performance:**
   - Runs smoothly at 60 FPS (hardware permitting).
